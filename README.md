# Khauta Sofe Maliehe

Hi there, I'm Khauta Sofe Maliehe, a software engineer and cyber security enthusiast based in Maseru, Lesotho. I'm currently working as a developer at Smartel Money Pty Ltd Lesotho, where I'm full time with some front end dev work. I've spent a great deal of my initial significant work as a lead engineer and project manager at Technomath, where I have been responsible for the development of the Marakeng App. Also when I'm not at Smartel Money I dedicate my time under @Liparola as a part time head of development & interesting projects (experimenting & building cool stuff that you like).

Apart from my work, I also do third-party consulting work and I'm available for freelance work. I'm passionate about making significant contributions to open-source projects, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any projects that you think I could contribute to.

## About Me

I believe in the value of our own individual uniqueness, and I strive to bring my unique perspective to every project that I work on. When I'm not coding, I enjoy cycling and taking morning walks to calm my monkey mind.
